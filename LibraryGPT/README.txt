# UtilityLibrary

## Introduction and Purpose

`UtilityLibrary` is a comprehensive collection of utility functions and methods designed to simplify and enhance the development of .NET WinForms applications. The library encapsulates a wide range of functionalities, from UI operations to threading, design patterns, and more, providing developers with a modular and reusable set of tools.

## How to Use the Library

1. Add a reference to `LibraryGPT.dll` in your project.
2. Import the necessary namespaces.
3. Call the desired methods or instantiate the classes as needed.

## Descriptions of Main Classes and Methods

- **UIUtilities**: Contains methods for dynamic control creation, UI enhancements, and other GUI operations.
- **ThreadingUtilities**: Offers functions related to threading, async operations, and non-blocking UI updates.
- **DataUtilities**: Provides methods for data manipulation and validation.
- **FileAndIOUtilities**: Houses functions for file operations and other I/O tasks.
- ... [Continue with other classes]

## Examples of Usage

```csharp
// Using ThreadingUtilities for non-blocking UI updates
await ThreadingUtilities.UpdateTextBoxAsync(myTextBox);

// Implementing the Factory pattern from PatternImplementations
IAnimal animal = PatternImplementations.AnimalFactory.CreateAnimal("dog");
```

## Dependencies or Prerequisites

- .NET Framework (version you're targeting, e.g., .NET Framework 4.7.2 or .NET 5)
- [Any other external libraries or packages you might be using]

## Version History

- **1.0.0** - Initial release with basic utilities.
- **1.1.0** - Added design patterns and enhanced UI utilities.
- ... [Continue with other versions]
