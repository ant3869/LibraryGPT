# LibraryGPT

Welcome to LibraryGPT, a comprehensive utility library designed to streamline various aspects of c# and winforms development. This library encompasses a wide range of utilities, from configuration and data handling to UI and security. All code generated by chatGPT 4 with prompts and prodding by me. A collection I plan on updating whenever possible to see how many "universal" (for the most part) methods I can get her to lend me.

## Dependencies or Prerequisites

- .NET Framework 4.8

## How to Use the Library

1. Add a reference to `LibraryGPT.dll` in your project.
2. Import the necessary namespaces.
3. Call the desired methods or instantiate the classes as needed.

## Examples of Usage

```csharp
// Using ThreadingUtilities for non-blocking UI updates
await ThreadingUtilities.UpdateTextBoxAsync(myTextBox);

// Implementing the Factory pattern from PatternImplementations
IAnimal animal = PatternImplementations.AnimalFactory.CreateAnimal("dog");
```

## TL;DR
Collection of A.I generated, human tweaked, all purpose functions for use in c# and Winforms focused development. 

**Features:**
- **Configuration Utilities**: Fetch and set configuration settings, manage environment variables, handle configuration files.
- **Data Handling**: JSON and XML serialization/deserialization, email format validation.
- **Database Utilities**: Asynchronous SQL command execution, connection string management.
- **Design Patterns**: Common design patterns like Singleton, Factory Method, Adapter, Decorator, Observer, and Strategy.
- **Dialog Utilities**: Simplified dialog box creation for information, error, and warning messages, user input handling.
- **Event Utilities**: Custom event handling and logging.
- **Exception Handling**: Utility methods for common exception handling scenarios.
- **Security**: Encryption and decryption of strings.
- **Other Utilities**: UI, Task, Threading, and various other utility classes.





## Main Classes and Methods

**UIUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Facilitates dynamic control creation and enhances user interface elements.  
**Examples:** Dynamic control resizing, password input field, tab controls, context menus, custom drawing, tooltips, etc.

**ThreadingUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Manages threading, asynchronous operations, and ensures non-blocking UI updates.  
**Examples:** Using async/await for non-blocking UI, BackgroundWorker for threaded operations, Invoke for cross-thread UI updates, etc.

**DataUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Provides robust methods for data manipulation and validation.  
**Examples:** Using LINQ for data manipulation, data validation, clipboard operations, etc.

**FileAndIOUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Offers a suite of functions for file operations and input/output tasks.  
**Examples:** File operations (reading/writing), detecting USB insertion/removal, etc.

**EventAndDelegateUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Functions and patterns related to events, delegates, and custom event arguments.  
**Examples:** Custom events with EventArgs, implementing triggers/delegates, etc.

**PatternImplementations**  
**Purpose:** Implementations of various design patterns.  
**Examples:** Factory pattern, strategy pattern, observer pattern, command pattern, decorator pattern, state pattern, etc.

**WebUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Functions related to web operations, scraping, and web-based tasks.  
**Examples:** Web scraping functions, web-based ticket automation, etc.

**HardwareUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Functions related to hardware interactions and operations.  
**Examples:** Detecting USB insertion/removal.

**FormUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Functions specifically related to form operations and events.  
**Examples:** Hide form to system tray, handle form closing event, resize controls with form, etc.

**TaskUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Functions related to tasks, timers, and scheduled operations.  
**Examples:** Timed actions, using Task.Run for fire-and-forget operations, etc.

**ExtensionMethods**  
**Purpose:** General utility functions that extend existing classes for added functionality.  
**Examples:** String extensions, list extensions, etc.

**DatabaseUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Functions related to database operations, queries, and data retrieval.  
**Examples:** Simple database operations using ADO.NET or Entity Framework.

**ConfigurationUtilities**  
**Purpose:** Functions related to configuration, settings, and user preferences.  
**Examples:** Using a configuration file, save and load user preferences, etc.
